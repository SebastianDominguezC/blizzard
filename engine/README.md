# Blizzard Game Engine ❄️

This library is a custom ECS game engine developed for integration with the Blizzard Server Engine.
These two together can be used to develop TCP multiplayer games.
However, the idea is that Blizzard will also work for any type of game, not just TCP or online games.
Blizzard will be a modular game engine.

As of now, it is just an ECS data engine.

Some features in the roadmap:

- Debugger
- Platform abstraction
- Window abstraction
- Event handler
- Renderer API with OpenGL
- AI solutions
- Many, many more features...
