# Blizzard Server Engine ❄️

This library along with the Blizzard Game Engine is an all-in-one solution to develop TCP multiplayer games.
Please see website to understand how the Blizzard Game and Server engines work!
You can also see an example in the GitHub repo, inside the example lib.

As of now, the game engine is just an ECS data engine.
